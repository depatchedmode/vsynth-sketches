# you'll need:

+ Max 8+
+ vsynth v1.4+
+ syphon package (optional)
+ a cool room
+ patience & an ability to tolerate incredibly disorganized patches

# how it's organized

In folders by year, and then filename by day. Each piece is a max patch 
and accompanying presets `.json` file.

`YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD - ridiculous title.maxpat`
`YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD - ridiculous title.json`

If you follow my Instagram and want to know how a piece was generated, it's
99% likely to be in this repository. And a 75% chance it's easy to find using the following system:

1. find the date it was posted to Instagram (eg. 2021-05-30)
3. find a file with that date. the title may or may not match the title of the post.
4. does a preset in that file match what you see in the post? great!
5. no luck? try looking at the previous date's file.
6. still no luck? you might need to check a few different files in the previous 2-3 weeks.
